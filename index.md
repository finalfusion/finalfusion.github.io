# Introduction

finalfusion is a file format for word embeddings and an associated set
of libraries and utilities. The file format has the following features:

* Word and subword vocabularies.
* Regular and quantized embedding matrices.
* Memory mapping of embedding matrices.

We also provide
[finalfrontier](https://github.com/finalfusion/finalfrontier) to train
finalfusion embeddings.

# Pretrained embeddings

We provide a growing set of [pretrained](pretrained) embeddings.

# Libraries

finalfusion libraries are available for:

* [Rust](https://docs.rs/finalfusion)
* [Python](python)

# Specification

If you are interesed in implementing your own library for the
finalfusion format, please see [version 0](spec) of the finalfusion
specification.
