# Introduction

finalfusion is a file format for word embeddings and an associated set
of libraries and utilities. The file format has the following features:

* Word and subword vocabularies.
* Regular and quantized embedding matrices.
* Memory mapping of embedding matrices.

# Pretrained embeddings

We provide a growing set of [pretrained](pretrained) embeddings.

# Libraries

I would ike to use finalfusion embeddings in:

* [Rust](https://docs.rs/finalfusion)
* [Python](python)
